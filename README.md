# **Instruction**

I. Basic knowledge

Here are list of course you need to learn before coding.

1. [Python programming](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). Choose any course as you want, in my point of view, w3school is a good resource for newbie.

2. Programming pradigm. We regularly use functional programming, after that refactoring functions into class (object-oriented programming). Make sure that you understand the definition of function (higher order function), function's parameter, calling function, ...

3. Know how to use programming tool, include: [Visual Studio Code](https://youtu.be/B-s71n0dHUk?si=J9WeW0wnW-040XGi) (how to create project - folder - file, how to run code, ...), [Jupyter notebook in Visual Studio Code](https://youtu.be/DA6ZAHBPF1U?si=biEPT0TpUhCsek4K) and [Git/Github](https://youtu.be/HkdAHXoRtos?si=C9V_QZJvkvOv3JWc) (if you have time).

4. How to program with [qiskit](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-Vvp2xg9-POLJhQwtVktlYGbY&si=_MtET8APVPHDZP7Z).

II. Installation:

1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), and an editor such as Visual Studio Code.

2. Python 3.10+, download on python.org.

3. Clone the codes to your local computer (**qsee** is a core package of our various repositories)
```
git clone https://github.com/vutuanhai237/QuantumBattery.git
cd UC-VQA
rm -rf qsee (delete folder qsee)
git clone https://github.com/vutuanhai237/qsee.git
```

Make sure that you see the **qsee** folder in the project

4. Install all needed packages.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
III. Project
